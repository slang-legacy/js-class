#What You Can Do With JS

"What can you do with JS?" is a question whose answer has changed massivly over the short life of this language

##History
JavaScript started around 1994, as a experimental language at Netscape, built to compete with VisualBasic in the market for non-professional programmers. It was made to complement Java, but doesn't share many of Java's features.

After being standardized by Ecma International (as ECMAScript) in 1996 and being implemented in popular webbrowsers of the time (such as IE3), JS became the defacto language for client-side web development. This is still it's primary use today, and has been a driving force in it's growth.

##Current
More recently, JS has gained the attention of professional programmers with powerful features allowing for the use of AJAX/AJAJ. Also, JS has become popular as a server-side platform (thanks to NodeJS) which has led some shops to switch to a pure JS stack. For example, Mozilla's B2G & FirefoxOS projects have resulted in a JavaScript based OS targeted at mobile phones. With these "outside of the browser" uses JavaScript is able to be used to develop nearly any type of desktop application. It still needs to be intrepreted, which prevents its use for programming microcontrollers, but that is a very small limitation.

##Overview
In short, JS has evolved from a limited in-browser language into a language that can be used on nearly any computing platform (including mobile).
