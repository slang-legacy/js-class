JS-Class
========

This is a repo containing almost all of the assignments I did for a JavaScript class that I took at Waukesha North Highschool. I already knew JS well before I took the class (I was just taking it for credits), so I attempted to make as many of these as possible into 1-liners. Well, anyway, you can use this stuff for whatever you want so... enjoy.
