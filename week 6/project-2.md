#Week 6 Project 2

In a html file write the JavaScript code that will display the following while loop in a div. Submit your completed file here. If the images does not show up in this text box, I have attached it below as well.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		<script>
			i = -1;
			while (i++ < 5)
				document.getElementById('write').innerHTML += 'The number is ' + i + '<br/>';
		</script>
		<p id="write"></p>
	</body>
</html>
```
